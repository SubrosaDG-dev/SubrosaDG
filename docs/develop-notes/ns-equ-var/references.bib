  abstract = {Discontinuous Galerkin methods, originally developed in the advective case, have been successively extended to advection\textendash diffusion problems, and are now used in very diverse applications. We here consider the numerical solution of the compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier\textendash Stokes and k\textendash{$\omega$} turbulence model equations by means of DG space discretization and implicit time integration. Detailed description of the DG discretization of the viscous part of the equations and of several implementation details of the k\textendash{$\omega$} turbulence model are given. To assess the performance of the proposed methodology we present the results obtained in the computation of the turbulent flow over a flat plate and of the turbulent unsteady wake developing behind a turbine blade.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with a high-order accurate discontinuous finite element method for the numerical solution of the compressible Navier\textendash Stokes equations. We extend a discontinuous finite element discretization originally considered for hyperbolic systems such as the Euler equations to the case of the Navier\textendash Stokes equations by treating the viscous terms with a mixed formulation. The method combines two key ideas which are at the basis of the finite volume and of the finite element method, the physics of wave propagation being accounted for by means of Riemann problems and accuracy being obtained by means of high-order polynomial approximations within elements. As a consequence the method is ideally suited to compute high-order accurate solution of the Navier\textendash Stokes equations on unstructured grids. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by computing the compressible viscous flow on a flat plate and around a NACA0012 airfoil for several flow regimes using constant, linear, quadratic, and cubic elements.},

These schemes are defined on general triangulations. They can easily handle the boundary conditions, verify maximum principles, and are formally uniformly high-ordrr accurate. Preliminary numerical results showing the performance of the schemes on a variety of initial-boundary value problems are shown.},

These equations are solved to produce weights and abscissas for quadrature rules of polynomial degree up to 11 for the triangle, some of which require fewer function evaluations than any presently available rule of the same polynomial degree. Cytolic rules of degrees up to 9 are also derived.}
